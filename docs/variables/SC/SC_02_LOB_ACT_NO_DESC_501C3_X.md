## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values are checkbox codes | 100.0% of values are X / true / false / 1 / 0 |
| ⓘ info | Meaning of a blank | 100% of values are explicit false/0, so a missing value is not the same as unchecked |
| ✓ pass | Element names agree in polarity | all element names have the same polarity |

### Flags

| Flag | Severity | Xpath | Detail | Review |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| `INCIDENCE_BREAK` | ▲ warn | (variable) | 990EZ fill rate changes up to 3.9x year-on-year (in 2012) | open |
