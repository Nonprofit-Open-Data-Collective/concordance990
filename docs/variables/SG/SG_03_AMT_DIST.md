## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 1.5x (IRS990ScheduleG/DistributedAmt, 990, TY2020) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.1x |
| ⓘ info | Sign convention | 0.0% of values are negative (fine for net amounts) |

No flags.

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990ScheduleG/AmountDistributed` | SZ | 2009–2012 | 3,676 | 0.471% |  |
| x2 | `IRS990ScheduleG/DistributedAmt` | SZ | 2013–2024 | 26,210 | 0.564% |  |
| x3 | `IRS990ScheduleG/Form990ScheduleGPartIII/AmountDistributed` | SZ | not observed | 0 |  |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
