## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
