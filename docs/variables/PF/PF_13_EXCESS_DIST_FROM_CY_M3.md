| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 3.8x (IRS990PF/UndistributedIncomeGrp/ExcessFromYear3Amt, 990PF, TY2022) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.2x |
| ⓘ info | Sign convention | 0.0% of values are negative (fine for net amounts) |

occurs more than once.

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
