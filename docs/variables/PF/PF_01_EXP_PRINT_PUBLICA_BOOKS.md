## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990PF/AnalysisOfRevenueAndExpenses/PrintingAndPubRevAndExpnss` | PF | 2009–2012 | 5,652 | 5.34% |  |
| x2 | `IRS990PF/AnalysisOfRevenueAndExpenses/PrintingAndPubRevAndExpnssAmt` | PF | 2013–2024 | 66,632 | 8.48% |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
