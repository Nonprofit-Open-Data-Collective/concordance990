## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

| x2 | `IRS990PF/AnalysisOfRevenueAndExpenses/AccountingFeesRevAndExpnssAmt` | PF | 2013–2024 | 692,125 | 66.4% |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
