## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 2.0x (IRS990PF/PrivateOperatingFoundationsGrp/TotalAssetsGrp/Year3Amt, 990PF, TY2022) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.2x |
| ⓘ info | Sign convention | 0.1% of values are negative (fine for net amounts) |

No flags.

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990PF/PrivateOperatingFoundations/TotalAssets/Year3` | PF | 2009–2012 | 3,087 | 3.22% |  |
| x2 | `IRS990PF/PrivateOperatingFoundationsGrp/TotalAssetsGrp/Year3Amt` | PF | 2013–2024 | 31,686 | 3.31% |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

| Fill rate: % of all filings of the return type (largest xpath) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 990-PF | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.

## Values

| Return | Filings | % numeric | % zero | % negative | P25    | Median  | P75       | P99        |
