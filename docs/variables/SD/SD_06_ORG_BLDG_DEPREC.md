## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 1.9x (IRS990ScheduleD/Buildings/Depreciation, 990, TY2010) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.5x |
| ⓘ info | Sign convention | 0.1% of values are negative (fine for net amounts) |

No flags.

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |

its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.
