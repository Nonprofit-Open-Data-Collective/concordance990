## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 1.6x (IRS990ScheduleA/DistributionAllocationsGrp/ExcessFromYear2Amt, 990, TY2020) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.0x |
| ⓘ info | Sign convention | 0.0% of values are negative (fine for net amounts) |

No flags.

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990ScheduleA/DistributionAllocationsGrp/ExcessFromYear2Amt` | SZ | 2014–2024 | 29,945 | 0.813% |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

## Coverage by tax year

| Filings | ’09 | ’10 | ’11 | ’12 | ’13 | ’14 | ’15 | ’16 | ’17 | ’18 | ’19 | ’20 | ’21 | ’22 | ’23 | ’24 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 |  |  |  |  |  | 1.3k | 1.3k | 1.5k | 2.1k | 2.1k | 2.9k | 3.6k | 3.6k | 3.8k | 4.1k | 3.7k |
| Fill rate: % of all filings of the return type (largest xpath) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 990 |  |  |  |  |  | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 990-EZ |  |  |  |  |  | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.

## Values

| Return | Filings | % numeric | % zero | % negative | P25 | Median | P75 | P99       |
