## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values are checkbox codes | 100.0% of values are X / true / false / 1 / 0 |
| ⓘ info | Meaning of a blank | values are almost always X/true when present, so a missing value usually means unchecked |
| ✓ pass | Element names agree in polarity | all element names have the same polarity |

No flags.

## Xpaths
