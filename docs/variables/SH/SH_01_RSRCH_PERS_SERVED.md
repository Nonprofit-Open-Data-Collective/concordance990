## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.3x |

### Flags

| Flag | Severity | Xpath | Detail | Review |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| `INCIDENCE_BREAK` | ▲ warn | (variable) | 990 fill rate changes up to 3.3x year-on-year (in 2024) | open |

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990ScheduleH/Research/PersonsServed` | SZ | 2009–2012 | 604 | 0.0785% |  |
| x2 | `IRS990ScheduleH/ResearchGrp/PersonsServedCnt` | SZ | 2013–2024 | 1,625 | 0.0123% |  |
| x3 | `IRS990ScheduleH/Form990ScheduleHPartI/Research/PersonsServed` | SZ | not observed | 0 |  |  |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

| Fill rate: % of all filings of the return type (largest xpath) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 990 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 | \<1 |

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.

## Values

| Return | Filings | % numeric | % zero | % negative | P25 | Median | P75   | P99    |
