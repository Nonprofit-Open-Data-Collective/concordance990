## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values are checkbox codes | 100.0% of values are X / true / false / 1 / 0 |
| ⓘ info | Meaning of a blank | 9% of values are explicit false/0, so a missing value is not the same as unchecked |
| ✓ pass | Element names agree in polarity | all element names have the same polarity |

### Flags

[TABLE]

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990ScheduleH/HospitalFcltyPoliciesPrctcGrp/StrategyPostedWebsiteInd` | SZ | 2014–2024 | 23,665 | 0.34% | 7.2% |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

## Coverage by tax year

| Filings | ’09 | ’10 | ’11 | ’12 | ’13 | ’14 | ’15 | ’16 | ’17 | ’18 | ’19 | ’20 | ’21 | ’22 | ’23 | ’24 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 |  |  |  |  |  | 2.3k | 2.3k | 2.2k | 2.3k | 2.3k | 2.2k | 2.3k | 2.3k | 2.3k | 2.2k | 944 |
| Fill rate: % of all filings of the return type (largest xpath) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 990 |  |  |  |  |  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \<1 |

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.

## Values

| Value   | Filings | Share |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `1`     | 12,295  | 51.9% |
| `true`  | 9,156   | 38.7% |
| `0`     | 1,130   | 4.8%  |
| `false` | 1,108   | 4.7%  |
