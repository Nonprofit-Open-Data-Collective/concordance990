## Checks

### Value checks

| Result | Value check | Detail |
|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values parse as numbers | 100.0% of values are numeric |
| ✓ pass | No sudden change in the median between adjacent years | largest change 1.0x (IRS990ScheduleH/HospitalFcltyPoliciesPrctcGrp/FPGFamilyIncmLmtFreeCarePct, 990, TY2023) |
| ✓ pass | Pooled xpaths are on the same scale (same return type) | largest ratio of medians between xpaths: 1.0x |
| ✓ pass | One scale across xpaths (fraction vs percent) | IRS990ScheduleH/HospitalFcltyPoliciesPrctcGrp/FPGFamilyIncmLmtFreeCarePct: large count or amount |

## Xpaths

|  | Xpath (under /Return/ReturnData or /Return/ReturnHeader) | Form | Years | Filings | % filers | Repeats in |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x1 | `IRS990ScheduleH/HospitalFcltyPoliciesPrctcGrp/FPGFamilyIncmLmtFreeCarePct` | SZ | 2013–2024 | 26,048 | 0.345% | 7.8% |

**% filers**: percent of in-scope filers whose return has the xpath, in
its latest year. **Repeats in**: share of filings where the element
occurs more than once.

## Coverage by tax year

| Filings | ’09 | ’10 | ’11 | ’12 | ’13 | ’14 | ’15 | ’16 | ’17 | ’18 | ’19 | ’20 | ’21 | ’22 | ’23 | ’24 |

| Fill rate: % of all filings of the return type (largest xpath) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 990 |  |  |  |  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \<1 |

Filings with a value, by xpath (rows, numbered as in the xpath table)
and tax year. A change of row from one year to the next is usually the
IRS renaming the element (most were renamed in 2013). Hover a cell for
the exact count.

## Values

| Return | Filings | % numeric | % zero | % negative | P25 | Median | P75 | P99 |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|------------|-----|--------|-----|-----|
| 990    | 26,048  | 100.0%    | 0.4%   | 0.0%       | 150 | 200    | 200 | 400 |
