|----|----|----|
| ✓ pass | Values are checkbox codes | 100.0% of values are X / true / false / 1 / 0 |
| ⓘ info | Meaning of a blank | 100% of values are explicit false/0, so a missing value is not the same as unchecked |
| ✓ pass | Element names agree in polarity | all element names have the same polarity |

No flags.
